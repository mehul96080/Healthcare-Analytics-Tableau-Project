# Healthcare-Analytics-Tableau-Project
Tableau Project Overview

Objective: Develop a Tableau workbook using the Healthcare dataset (CSV file) to create two dashboards and a story for analyzing patient health data.

Instructions:

Data Connection:

Connect to the Healthcare CSV file.
Use an Extract connection in Tableau (Desktop or Public).
Dashboard Creation:

Dashboard 1:
Include an image related to healthcare.
Use a Text object to provide a meaningful title based on data analysis.
Dashboard 2:
View 1: Display diabetic vs. non-diabetic patients using Shapes, with a calculated field to classify patients and show percent distribution. Tooltip should show patient count.
View 2: Summarize patients by Blood Pressure category using shapes, showing patient count and BP category, with color differentiation for diabetic vs. non-diabetic patients.
View 3: Create a Histogram of BMI by Age Groups with bins of size 5, displaying average BMI values with a color palette.
View 4: Display a single Bar Chart showing the percent distribution of patients by BMI type (Underweight, Healthy Weight, Overweight, Obese).
Story Creation:

Name the Story: "Healthcare."
Title: "Healthcare Summary Report."
Layout: Navigator style with numbered story points.
Story Points:
Point 1: Dashboard 1.
Point 2: Dashboard 2.
Point 3: Heat Map Worksheet showing health factors by Age group.
Submission:

Compile screenshots of each view into a Word document.
Ensure all worksheets are hidden before publishing the workbook to Tableau Public (if applicable).
This project aims to visualize and analyze healthcare data to provide insights into patient health metrics and distribution.
